Predicting the defaulters of a credit card.

Credit card default happens when you have become severely delinquent on your credit card payments. 
Default is a serious credit card status that affects not only your standing with that credit card issuer but also your credit standing in general and your ability to get approved for other credit-based services.
When you accept a credit card, you agree to certain terms. 
For example, you agree to make your minimum payment by the due date listed on your credit card statement. 

If you miss the minimum payment six months in a row, your credit card will be in default. 
Your credit card issuer will likely close your account and report the default to the credit bureaus.
